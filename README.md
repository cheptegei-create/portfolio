# David Cheptegei's Portfolio

## Description

Employers in the tech industry prefer candidates with well prepared portfolios. A portfolio assists a lot during interviews by avoiding to explain what you can do. The main reason for building this website is to have a platform where I can showcase my work to employers. The website enables me to present my work to a potential employer as proof of what I can do. I learned that with CSS one can build a selling and eye appealing portfolio.
